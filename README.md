# Coursera_Capstone
Repository containing capstone project for IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate (WIP).

Week 1 Notebook is just a test of publishing to GitHub directly from IBM Watson Studio.
Week 3 Notebook is webscraping data from Wikipedia page containing postal codes in Canada, transferring the data into a pandas dataframe, cleaning and organzing the data, and finally using that data along with k-means clustering and the Folium library to generate geospatial, interactive maps displaying the clustered neighborhoods.
