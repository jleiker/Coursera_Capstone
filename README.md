# Coursera_Capstone
Repository containing capstone project for IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate (WIP).

Week 1 Notebook is just a test of publishing to GitHub directly from IBM Watson Studio.

Week 3 Notebook is webscraping data from Wikipedia page containing postal codes in Canada, transferring the data into a pandas dataframe, cleaning and organzing the data, and finally using that data along with k-means clustering and the Folium library to generate geospatial, interactive maps displaying the clustered neighborhoods.

Weeks 4 and 5 are the actual project itself. My project is titled "Opening a Fitness Center Based on Regional Health Patterns." It deals with analyzing readily available health data from the USDA ERS and location data from FourSquare to determine the optimal location for opening a new fitness center.
